A vote listener designed to encourage people to consistently vote. Inferno is inspired by a decompiled version of [Vote Streak](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vote-streak.58753/). Inferno builds on the idea of vote streaks, adding incremental rewards, encouraging players to vote more often. 

Inferno is completely open source, so feel free to use it and modify it as you wish. âœ¨
